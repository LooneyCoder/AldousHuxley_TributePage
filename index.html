				<li>Aldous Leonard Huxley (1894 – 1963) was a prolific English writer and philosopher, widely acknowledged as one of the most important and visionary intellectuals of his time.</li> 
				<li>Aldous was the author of nearly fifty books, including well-known novels like the dystopic Brave New World (1932); wide-ranging essays and comparative studies like The Perennial Philosophy (1944)</li> 
				<li>The Doors of Perception (1954), was an interpretation of Huxley’s psychedelic experience with mescaline (and the reason Jim Morrison named his band ‘The Doors’).</li> 
				<li>In 1921 he published his debut novel Crome Yellow, a social satire of English intelligentsia which brought Huxley his first taste of success. </li> 
				<li>While traveling throughout Europe, he followed this with several more equally successful, satirical novels before purchasing a villa in the South of France. It was here that he wrote and published ‘Brave New World’, a bleak vision of the future widely regarded as one of the greatest novels of the 20th century.</li> 
				<li>Following the success of Brave New World, Huxley moved to Hollywood in 1937. There he was introduced to Vedanta Hinduism, and became a friend of the renowned speaker and author Swami Jiddu Krishnamurti. Together with Gerald Heard, Christopher Isherwood and other followers, Huxley became heavily involved with the Vedanta Society of Southern California, learning the meditation and spiritual practices of Vivekananda with the Swami. Huxley’s work during this time showed the influence of his Vedic teachings: his fiction becoming more mystical and concerned with issues of physical and mental perception. It was during these spiritually formative years that Huxley penned the novel-length comparative study of mysticism called The Perennial Philosophy.</li> 
				<li>Over the next eight years, Huxley continued his exploration of mysticism, growing increasingly interested in the use of psychedelics as a means of probing perception. In the spring of 1953, he had his first experience with the drug mescaline. The Doors of Perception, published the following year, is a direct account of his experiences while on the drug. </li> 
				<li>
					Delving further into hallucinogenics, Huxley later had an experience on LSD that he considered more profound than those of mescalin detailed in The Doors of Perception. Interviewed by The Paris Review in 1960, Huxley said: “(LSD) shows that the world one habitually lives in is merely a creation of this conventional, closely conditioned being which one is, and that there are quite other kinds of worlds outside. It’s a very salutary thing to realize that the rather dull universe in which most of us spend most of our time is not the only universe there is.”
				</li>

					While Huxley maintained his spiritual skepticism until his death, he is remembered as a passionate humanist and innately curious explorer of the mind. Writing prolifically until dying from laryngeal cancer in Los Angeles, California, in 1963, Huxley was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature seven times, and in 1962, was elected Companion of Literature by the Royal Society of Literature. He approached his death with much the same sense of exploration that he approached life: Following a written request to his wife, Huxley was injected with 2 consecutive doses of LSD, allowing him to pass in a state he had written about so passionately.
